-- account_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
-- Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
--  

-- Write a solution to calculate the number of bank accounts for each salary category. The salary categories are:

-- "Low Salary": All the salaries strictly less than $20000.
-- "Average Salary": All the salaries in the inclusive range [$20000, $50000].
-- "High Salary": All the salaries strictly greater than $50000.
-- The result table must contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, return 0.

-- Return the result table in any order.
